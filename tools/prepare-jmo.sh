#
# TWO artifacts per series cover every operating system. jamovi's only
# compatibility gate is an exact string compare of the artifact's rVersion
# against the app's JAMOVI_R_VERSION, and that string carries the R version and
# the CPU but no OS component.
#
# Safe only for a module with no compiled code; the guard below enforces that.
# prognosis is pure R (survival, ggplot2 and gtable come from jamovi itself).
